# Verifiable Multi-Highlight Tool: A Case Study in Privacy-First Development and AI Collaboration

### A Technical Deep Dive

## About Me & My Philosophy

### The "Why" Behind the "How"

- Lead Software Engineer, Developer Experience (DevEx) Champion, and Team Catalyst üß°
- **Core Principles**
- **Mentorship** 
- **Mission**

<!-- 
* **Core Principles:** Technology choices should prioritize long-term sustainability, transparency, and maintainability.
* **Mentorship:** Empowering colleagues, pair progamming, and growth focused code reviews.
* **Mission:** To create tools and processes that help teams do their best work. Force Multiplier.
 -->

## Project Selection Context

### Why a Personal Project?

* Much of my professional work is proprietary and covered by NDAs.
* I chose a recent, open-source project to allow for a fully transparent discussion.
* This project was a personal exploration into:
    * Modern Chrome Extension development.
    * The practical boundaries of AI-assisted coding.
    * The full product lifecycle: from idea to the official Chrome Web Store.

---

## The Problem Statement

### The Search for a Trustworthy Tool

* **Goal:** Find a browser extension to highlight multiple keywords on a page.
* **Problem:** Existing solutions lacked a critical feature: **Trust.**
* Extensions with this functionality require invasive permissions (`"read all your data on all websites"`).
* No available options were open-source, making it impossible to verify that user data wasn't being tracked or sent to a third party.
* This presented an unacceptable privacy and security risk.

---

## The Solution: A Verifiable Highlighter

### If you want it done right, build it yourself.

* A Chrome extension to find and highlight multiple keywords.
* **Core Mandate #1: Privacy First.** All operations are 100% local to the browser. No network calls, no data exfiltration.
* **Core Mandate #2: Verifiable.** Fully open-source so anyone can audit the code and confirm the privacy claims.
* **Functionality:**
    * Accepts a list of words.
    * Highlights all occurrences on a page.
    * Persists word lists using local storage.

---

## Requirements Gathering: An Iterative Process

### From Static Pages to a Dynamic Web

* **Initial Requirements:**
    * Must be open-source and make no network calls.
    * Users can add/remove multiple keywords.
    * Keywords are saved between sessions.
* **Evolved Requirement (Discovered during use):**
    * **The SPA Problem:** On sites like LinkedIn, content loads dynamically without a full page refresh. The initial highlighting logic would miss this new content.
    * **New Requirement:** The extension must detect page content changes and re-apply highlighting automatically.

## The Core Experiment: AI as a Pair Programmer

### A Human-in-the-Loop, AI-Driven Approach

* **The "Pseudo-Requirement":** I would not write any of the functional code myself.
* **My Role:** Acted as the senior engineer/architect.
    * Provided clear, technical prompts to the AI (GitHub Copilot).
    * Performed rigorous code reviews on every line of generated code.
    * Asked the AI to explain complex or unfamiliar concepts.
* **The Goal:** To explore the capabilities and limitations of AI as a development partner and learn how to leverage it effectively.

---

## Technology Selection: The Power of Simplicity

### Why Plain JavaScript?

* **Primary Goal:** Verifiability and Transparency.
* While tools like TypeScript or Rust/WASM are powerful, they add a compilation/transpilation step.
* This obfuscates the final code, making it harder for a non-expert to audit and trust.
* Plain JavaScript ensures that "what you see is what you get." The code in the repository is the code that runs in the browser.
* This decision directly supports the core mission of creating a provably private tool.

## My AI Toolkit: The Right Tool for the Job

### Delineating AI Roles

Two primary AI partners were used for distinct tasks:

* **GitHub Copilot:**
    * **Role:** The Code Generator.
    * **Tasks:** Writing functions, implementing logic, modifying the manifest file, navigating the Chrome extension APIs.
* **Gemini:**
    * **Role:** The Prose & Documentation Generator.
    * **Tasks:** Authoring the justifications for store permissions, writing the "About" page, answering the Chrome Store's compliance questionnaire.

---

## Challenge 1: Taming Single Page Applications (SPAs)

* **The Problem:** Dynamically loaded content was not being highlighted.
* **The Solution:**
    1.  **Trigger:** Use an event listener to monitor for network calls, a reliable heuristic for when new content might have appeared.
    2.  **Logic:** When a network call completes, trigger the highlighting function.
    3.  **Refinement:** Re-running the highlighter created duplicate highlights. The process was updated to be a two-step sequence:
        * First, find and remove all existing highlight tags.
        * Then, perform a fresh highlighting pass on the entire document.
* **Outcome:** A robust solution that works seamlessly on modern, dynamic websites.

---

## Challenge 2: Resisting the Urge to "Just Fix It"

* **The Problem:** The AI often struggled with simple tasks (e.g., changing a width from `50px` to `100px`), proposing overly complex solutions. The temptation to manually intervene was immense.
* **The Approach:**
    * I treated the AI like an intern I was mentoring.
    * Instead of taking over, I refined my prompts, corrected its course, and guided it to the simple, correct solution.
* **Why?** This adhered to the project's experimental goal and provided deep insight into the AI's strengths (boilerplate, discovery) and weaknesses (context, simple edits). This was an exercise in patience and mentorship.

---

## Challenge 3: Becoming an AI-Assisted Artist

* **The Problem:** The Chrome Store requires numerous icons and promotional images, but I'm not a designer.
* **The Process:**
    1.  **Experiment:** Used a generative AI to create icon concepts as SVGs, iteratively refining them with prompts (`"make the handle longer"`).
    2.  **Roadblock:** Discovered the Chrome Store does not accept SVG files. üò±
    3.  **Pivot:** I had a perfect vector source but needed dozens of specific PNG sizes.
    4.  **Automation:** Prompted the AI to write a command-line script to take the master SVG and automatically convert it into all required PNG dimensions.

---

## Challenge 4: The Publishing Gauntlet

* **The Problem:** The Google Chrome Web Store review process.
* **Key Hurdles:**
    * **Manual Review:** Due to the powerful permissions required, the extension was flagged for a mandatory human review.
    * **Slow Iteration Cycle:** Each submission, even for a minor text change on the store page, took up to half a week for approval.
    * **Thorough Justification:** Required detailed explanations for why each permission was necessary.
* **How I Overcame It:**
    * Used Gemini to help draft clear, concise justifications for the reviewers.
    * Learned to batch changes and plan submissions to minimize delays.

## Key Takeaways

* **On AI Development:** AI is a powerful **accelerator**, not a replacement for engineering expertise. The senior developer's role shifts towards architecture, review, and precise prompt engineering.
* **On Privacy:** Building trustworthy software requires deliberate choices. Simplicity and transparency (like using plain JS) are features in themselves.
* **On Personal Projects:** They are invaluable for exploring new technologies and processes in a low-risk, high-learning environment.
