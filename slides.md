# Search Extension Project
## A Comprehensive Overview

---

## Requirements Gathering Approach

### Discovery Phase
- **Identified Core Need**: Efficient search functionality across multiple platforms
- **User Research**: Analyzed user workflows and pain points
- **Feature Prioritization**: Focused on must-have vs nice-to-have features

### Methodology
- Conducted user interviews and surveys
- Analyzed existing search solutions
- Created user stories and use cases
- Defined acceptance criteria for each feature
